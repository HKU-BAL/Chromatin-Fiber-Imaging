# Chromatin-Fiber-Imaging
## Introduction
The main aim of this tool is to automatically detect the molecular clusters with user-defined sizes from single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data and provide XY, YZ, and XZ projections for the observation and further filtering for the experts. The corresponding statistical information is also provided for reference, such as FWHM of X and Y dimension, length of Z, average localization precision, average photon count, position, max frame gap, etc.  A web server version is also provided: [Click here](http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/CFI)
